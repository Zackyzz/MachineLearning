An implementation of several Machine Learning algorithms, such as:
k-Means, Self Organizing Maps (Kohonen networks), BackPropagation (a classic neural network), Rocchio (Nearest Centroid Classifier) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The used data is hardcoded in each *.rkt script, but different toy datasets can be generated using the generatingDataset/dataset.rkt script.
